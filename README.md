# Autonomous Quadcopter Position Control using Visual Servoing Simulation in Gazebo
My second phase for my undergraduate thesis which is simulation the vision part, which is the crucial part on my undergraduate thesis. A Quadcopter navigation system using the visual sensor as it's main navigation sensor system to reach it's destination. This package program is a quadrotor simulation program forked from sjtu_drone, developed using ROS2 - Gazebo Simulation
